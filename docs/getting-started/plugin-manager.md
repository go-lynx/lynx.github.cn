# Plugin Management in go-lynx

In go-lynx, all functionalities are designed with a plugin-oriented mindset. This approach provides a high level of modularity and flexibility, allowing you to easily customize your application to suit your specific needs.

## Current Plugin Offerings

go-lynx currently offers a wide range of plugins, including:

1. Configuration Center
2. Registration Center
3. Link Tracking
4. Distributed Transactions
5. Message Queues
6. Database Connections
7. Redis
8. HTTP
9. GRPC
10. TLS Certificate Management

These plugins cover a wide range of functionalities, and the list is continually growing to accommodate various business scenarios.

## How to Extend Plugin Support

You can extend plugin support by implementing a few interfaces and registering the plugin to the global plugin factory. Here's an example of how you can do this:

```go
func init() {
	factory.GlobalPluginFactory().Register(name, confPrefix, func() plugin.Plugin {
		return Db()
	})
}
```

If you're unsure about this process, you can refer to how the official plugins are implemented in the go-lynx source code.

## Plugin Management Mechanism

go-lynx's plugin management mechanism supports automatic topological sorting to solve dependency issues. This corresponds to a directed acyclic graph, which facilitates automatic sequential loading of plugins.

## Future Enhancements

There are several areas of plugin management that are planned for future enhancement:

1. **Instance Management**: The ability to design plugins for multiple instances or a single instance, as well as managing multiple instances.
2. **Hot Updates**: The ability to update certain plugins' configuration files without any perceptible impact on the application, allowing for seamless plugin updates.
3. **State Management**: The need for a state machine to manage the state of plugins, enabling global dynamic closing and opening of plugins under certain circumstances.

With these enhancements, go-lynx will continue to improve its ability to provide a robust, flexible, and user-friendly platform for managing and deploying microservices.

## Conclusion

go-lynx's plugin-oriented design makes it a versatile tool for building and managing microservices. With a wide range of plugins already available and more on the way, you can customize your application to meet your specific needs, while also benefiting from the ongoing improvements and enhancements to the go-lynx platform.
