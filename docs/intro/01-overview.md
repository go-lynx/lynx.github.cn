# Introduction

Welcome to Go-Lynx, a plug-and-play microservices framework designed with extensibility and simplicity at its core.

## Philosophy

The core philosophy of Go-Lynx is integration through plugins. We view every capability as a plugin, making plugins the soul of Go-Lynx. All third-party components, database management, message queueing, monitoring, and all other capabilities that a microservice needs are managed through plugins.

Moreover, from the very beginning, we have designed Go-Lynx to allow integration between plugins, enabling the assembly of more powerful components for use. This means that when you're developing business logic, you can focus solely on that. Go-Lynx has already taken care of all other capabilities for you.
