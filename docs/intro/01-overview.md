# Overview

Welcome to Go-Lynx, a plug-and-play Go microservice framework designed with scalability and simplicity at its core.

> The name Go-Lynx is inspired by the lynx, a feline species, symbolizing the framework's flexibility and agility.

## Getting Started

To begin using Go-Lynx, check out our [Quick Start](/docs/getting-started/quick-start) guide: install the Lynx CLI, create a project with `lynx new`, and run with `lynx run --watch`. If you're already familiar with the basics, see the [Plugin Ecosystem](/docs/existing-plugin/plugin-ecosystem) for the full list of plugins and how to configure them.

## Goals

We are committed to providing a lightweight and flexible microservice development framework. We integrate various third-party plugins and tools for microservice governance, aiming to shorten the business development cycle and allow you to focus more on business delivery.

## Why Choose Go-Lynx?

With Go-Lynx, you can enjoy:

- **Focus on Business**: Let the underlying plugins handle all the enhancements and features, allowing you to concentrate on the most important thing - your business logic.
- **Plugin Extensibility**: Use existing plugins or create your own to extend the functionality of your application.
- **Easy Integration**: Plugins are designed to integrate with each other, enabling you to assemble powerful components tailored to your needs.
- **Plug-and-Play**: Easily insert the plugins you need and start building your application. Simply import the corresponding module, and the plugin takes effect.

Thank you for using Go-Lynx. We're excited to see what microservice modules you'll create!

## Underlying Dependencies

Go-Lynx primarily uses Kratos + Polaris as its core foundation for design and integration. However, as the version evolves, Go-Lynx may become more like a plugin glue, with the underlying components becoming plugin-based, like building blocks that can be combined to create any microservice module you need.
